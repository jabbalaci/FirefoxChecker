* if the checked process (here, Firefox) is running,
  this program requires 0% CPU, which is very good

* however, if the process (Firefox) is not running, then
  we need to iterate over every running process, which
  causes 2-4% CPU usage (on my desktop machine)

  TODO: figure out how to scan running processes once a second
        in a more efficient way
